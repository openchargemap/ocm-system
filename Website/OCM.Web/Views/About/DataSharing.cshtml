            We invite all charging networks to promote their charging locations for free via <em>Open Charge Map</em> by directly supplying EVSE charging station location information to us as an OCPI data feed for import and redistribution.
        </p>

        <p>If you are a user of an existing charging network and want them to provide accurate data to <em>Open Charge Map</em>, please email them directly and ask them to provide us a data feed, including a link to this page.</p>

        The benefits to charging networks include:
        <ul>
            <li>Freely promoting your network via our API and shared dataset to thousands of apps and services, delivering information to millions of EV drivers.</li>
            <li>Ensuring we can distribute the latest correct information for your network.</li>
        </ul>

        Our project goal is to distribute accurate information as widely as possible. We are not commercially related to any charging networks.

        <p style="font-weight:900;padding-top:1em">
            This is not the form to get an API key to use the Open Charge Map API, this form is for charging network operators to submit data to us. To just get an API Key sign in and go to <em>My Apps</em> in the <em>My Profile</em> menu.
