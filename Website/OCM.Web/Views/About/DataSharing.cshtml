            We invite all charging networks to promote their charging locations for free via <em>Open Charge Map</em> by directly supplying EVSE charging station location information to us as an OCPI data feed for import and redistribution.
        </p>

        <p>If you are a user of an existing charging network and want them to provide accurate data to <em>Open Charge Map</em>, please email them directly and ask them to provide us a data feed, including a link to this page.</p>

        The benefits to charging networks include:
        <ul>
            <li>Freely promoting your network via our API and shared dataset to thousands of apps and services, delivering information to millions of EV drivers.</li>
            <li>Ensuring we can distribute the latest correct information for your network.</li>
        </ul>

        Our project goal is to distribute accurate information as widely as possible. We are not commercially related to any charging networks.
